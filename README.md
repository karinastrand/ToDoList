ToDoLy is a todo list application. You can add projects and place tasks to them. Both the projects and the tasks can be edited. The project can be renamed, you can change its description and if they dont contain any tasks you can remove them. The tasks can be renamed, you can change description, due date. mark them as done and change which project they belong to. The tasks can be sorted by due date or name of project.
The tasks and projects are saved in files and the app fetches them when you start it.
